A classic action RPG heavily inspired by Diablo 1. 

Features:
	- Automatic map generation
	- Character stats system
	- Item system
	- GUI framework
	- Local multiplayer
	- Input abstraction (Keyboard/Controller support)
	- SQLite integration
	- frame-based multidirectional 2D animations
	
I was going to exchange the Diablo 1 images and sounds with more colorful "Gemstone"-type assets (hence the name "Element RPG"), but then abandoned the project. You can find some concepts in the 'dev' directory.
